 * This command is used to blur an image using a filtering algorithm.

 * a "Gaussian" blur (imagine the values to be heights of a 3D bar graph
 * to see how they form a coarse bell-like Gaussian surface). Blurring can be done
 * by applying the filter to every channel of every pixel to produce the output image.
