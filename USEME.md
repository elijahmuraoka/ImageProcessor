# USE ME

**Upon starting up the application, read the instructions on the screen.
Then you must first load an image to edit using this command:**

~~~~
> load {imageName} {imagePath}

Example: load Koala images/Koala.ppm
~~~~

**Use either of these commands if you would like to see an informational help menu**

~~~~
> menu
> help
~~~~

**After successfully executing this command you can modify a loaded image to your liking.
You can use any command as many times as you'd like. You can also reference multiple versions
of the same image as long as you create a new destination name, otherwise the old image will be
overwritten.**

**Once you are finished, you can save the image by using this command:**

~~~~
> save {imageName} {saveAsName} {imagePath} {extension}
