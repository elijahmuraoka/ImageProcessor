# USE ME (GUI)

**First, download the jar file and start the application. Then, once you are in the program,
you should be greeted by a welcome screen, and you must click the button that says
"Click to Load an Image". Next, a file chooser will pop up onto the screen. Choose the image
you would like to edit that must be in one of the following formats:
ppm, jpg, png, or bmp. A new screen should then pop up allowing you to do many more things
with the image you have just loaded. Please click on the 'menu' item in the top left corner
and navigate to the 'help' tab. Click this item and read through it carefully for understanding
how to use this program.**
